# Inactive Users

This module contains features to assist in managing registration and contact signup spam on Drupal sites with civicrm installed.

## Author

This module was written by Chris Burgess on behalf of fuzion.


## Configuration

No configuration required - just install it.

## How it works

This extension creates a view which you can use to identify and delete drupal users and puts their associated civicrm records in the trash. Page is accessible via: admin/people/inactive

Initially a view and a couple of hooks to remove associated contacts.

## Next steps

Extended to allow you to find users by ip address using for example the uiplog module.
